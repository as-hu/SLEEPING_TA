Project # : #1 The Sleeping Teaching Assistant

Description : Manage the students (threads) and helping task
QUESTION : A university computer science department has a teaching assistant (TA) who helps undergraduate students with their programming assignments during regular office hours. The TAâ€™s office is rather small and has room for only one desk with a chair and computer. There are three chairs in the hallway outside the office where students can sit and wait if the TA is currently helping another
student. When there are no students who need help during office hours, the TA sits at the desk and takes a nap. If a student arrives during office hours and finds the TA sleeping, the student must awaken the TA to ask for help. If a student arrives and finds the TA currently helping another student, the student
sits on one of the chairs in the hallway and waits. If no chairs are available, the student will come back at a later time.Using threads, mutex locks, and semaphores, implement a solution that coordinates the activities of the TA and the students.

### Structure
1. student: student threads have own semaphore
2. ta: ta thread has own semaphore

### Functions
1. stu_programming: students is waiting in random time (they are programming in this time), and notice to ta for help. if ta is helping a student already, other students are waiting chairs in hallway, but if chairs is full, students go to their programming task back
2. ta_teaching: ta is sleeping until notice is arrived from at least one student. if any student wake the ta up, ta will help the student. if helping is finished and chairs are empty, then ta go to sleeping back
3. rand_sleep: make sleeping time (it means programming task or helping tesk) randomly

### Simple process flows
1. make student threads and ta thread (initialize)
2. each thread is running own thread function (student is programming, ta is sleeping)
3. student will wake the ta up after randomly time, then ta will help the arrived student (change student's semaphore to 1 and wait ta's semaphore). but if chairs are full, students go to their programming back and return again after randomly time
4. if ta's help is finished, ta check the remaining students. if there is(are) student(s) ta is keeping the current state (help continuously) and if not, ta go to sleeping back (change ta's semaphore to 1 and wait student's semaphore)
5. repeat 3-4 steps
